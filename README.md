## Arithmetic operators
~~~ javascript
/*arithmetic operators= operands (values, variables, etc.)
                        operators (+ - * /)
                        ex. 11 = x + 5;

//students = students / 2;  -> division

//students = students ** 2; -> the (variable) is multiply by itself the amount of times that is define by the number after the "**"

//let extraStudents = students % 2; -> the module, the rest of the division

//students += 1; -> students = 31

//students -= 1; -> students = 29

//students *= 2; -> students = 60

//students /= 2; -> students = 15

//students **= 2; -> students = 900

//students %= 2; -> students = 0

//students++; -> students = 31

//students--; -> students = 29

## Operator precedence 

~~~ javascript
/*

    operator precedence 
    1. parenthesis ()
    2. exponents
    3. multiplication & division & modulo
    4. addition & subtraction
*/

let result = 1 + 2*3 + 4**2; // the result is 23

## How to accept user input 

### 1. EASY WAY = window prompt
~~~ javascript 

let username;

username = window.prompt("What's your username?")

console.log(username)

document.getElementById("p1").textContent = username

~~~

### 2. PROFESSIONAL WAY = HTML textbox

~~~ javascript 

let username;

document.getElementById("mySubmit").onclick = function(){
    username =  document.getElementById("myText").value;
    document.getElementById("myH1").textContent = `Hello ${username}`
}

~~~ 

~~~ javascript
let age = window.prompt("How old are you?");

age = Number(age);

age+=1;

console.log(age, typeof age)
~~~

## Type conversion

- Change the datatype of a value to another (strings, numbers, booleans)

~~~ javascript
let x = "pizza";
let y = "pizza";
let z = "pizza";

x = Number(x);
y = String(y);

z =  Boolean(z);

console.log(x, typeof x)
console.log(y, typeof y)
console.log(z, typeof z)
~~~

## Const

- A variable that can't be changed

~~~ javascript
//const = a variable that can't be changed

const pi = 3.14159;
let radius;
let circumference;



radius = window.prompt('Enter the radius of a circle')
radius = Number(radius);

circumference = 2 * pi * radius;

console.log(circumference)
~~~

~~~ javascript
const pi = 3.14159;
let radius;
let circumference;


console.log(circumference)

document.getElementById("mySubmit").onclick = function(){
    radius = document.getElementById("myText").value 
    radius = Number(radius);
    circumference = 2 * pi * radius;
    document.getElementById("myH3").textContent = circumference + "cm";
}
